# challenge 1

I play a game and want to be the best at it. In order to be the best, I need to win a certain amount of medals.

I need to win 20 battles to win my first medal.
Once I've won my first medal, I'll need to win 21 more battles to obtain a second one.
For the third I'll need 22 more victories, the fourth 23 more etc...

Example : 
```javascript
myFunction(1); // 20
myFunction(2); // 41
myFunction(3); // 63
```


How many battles do I need to win x medals.

Write a function whitout using loops and recursion which calculate the amount of victories needed to win x medals.
